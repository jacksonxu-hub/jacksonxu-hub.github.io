		This API takes a name and returns the probability that it is a female or male names.
		Website where I found it: https://genderize.io.
		In order to work with this API we need to provide the name for which we want to know the 
		corresponding gender.
		Thie could be useful in imputing data in large surveys where respondents only indicated their
		name but not gender. We could use this API to fill in the genders based on the likelihood that 
		the person with this name is male/female. This could also be useful if we are trying to figure
		out how to address the person in an email when facing a name that could be male or female when writing an email.
