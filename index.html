        <h3>Background and Motivation</h3>
        <p> I have taken a number of machine learning and data science classes at Tufts including cs119 (Big Data), 
            cs135 (Introduction to Machine Learning), and cs152 (Statistical BiCoinformatics) at Tufts. I don't have
            any software development experience but had worked in bioinformatics after college. I'm taking this
            class because I want to learn how to design and implement easy to use websites that non-programmers
            can easily interact with. In the future, I want to develop machine learning tools for text analysis that
            everyone can use easily on the web.

        <h3>Favorite Restaurant and Why I Like It </h3>
        <a href="https://www.chipotle.com"> Go to Restaurant</a>
        <br />	<br />	
        My favorite restaurant is chipotle because I'm a big fan of Mexican food and chipotle has a pretty generous
        selection of tortilla, bowls, and tacos with different ingredient options. It's also very affordable and 
        convenient (you can grab and go). Although the meals do have a lot of calories, many ingredients (e.g., beans)
        are very healthy and you can definitely get a balanced, not overly rich meal if you choose wisely.
